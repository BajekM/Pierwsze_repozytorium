    <h1>Bad liar</h1>
    <h2>Imagine dragons</h2>
    <p>Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year<br>
        And terrors don't prey on<br> 
        Innocent victims<br>
        Trust me, darling, trust me darling<br>
        It's been a loveless year<br>
        I'm a man of three fears<br>
        Integrity, faith and<br>
        Crocodile tears<br>
        Trust me, darling, trust me, darling</p>
    <p>So look me in the eyes<br>
        Tell me what you see<br>
        Perfect paradise<br>
        Tearing at the seams<br>
        I wish I could escape<br>
        I don't wanna fake it<br>
        Wish I could erase it<br>
        Make your heart believe</p>
    <p>But I'm a bad liar, bad liar<br>
        Now you know<br>
        Now you know<br>
        That I'm a bad liar, bad liar<br>
        Now you know, you're free to go (go)</p>
    <p>Did all my dreams never mean one thing?<br>
        Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?<br>
        Oh, I've been askin' for<br>
        Oh, I've been askin' for problems, problems, problems<br>
        I wage my war, on the world inside<br>
        I take my gun to the enemy's side<br>
        Oh,â€¦</p>
